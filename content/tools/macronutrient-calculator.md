## How Many Calories Should I Eat Per Day?

- Protein: It is calculated based on a ratio of 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. This is a commonly used ratio for athletes and active individuals.
- Fat: Fat is calculated as 25% of the adjusted TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) divided by 9 (since there are 9 calories per gram of fat).
- Carbohydrates: The remaining calories are assigned to carbohydrates. To calculate the grams of carbohydrates, subtract the calories from protein and fat from the adjusted TDEE and then divide by 4 (since there are 4 calories per gram of carbohydrate).

An example of a 2,400-calorie diet with the following approximate macronutrient distribution:

- 30% protein (180 grams) 720 calories
- 30% fat (80 grams) 720 calories
- 40% carbohydrates (240 grams) 960 calories

To calculate the number of grams for each macronutrient, use the following steps:

- Protein: 30% of 2,400 calories = 720 calories, and since there are 4 calories per gram of protein, 720 / 4 = 180 grams of protein
- Fat: 30% of 2,400 calories = 720 calories, and since there are 9 calories per gram of fat, 720 / 9 = 80 grams of fat
- Carbohydrates: 40% of 2,400 calories = 960 calories, and since there are 4 calories per gram of carbohydrate, 960 / 4 = 240 grams of carbohydrates

Using this macronutrient distribution, a 2,400-calorie diet would consist of approximately 180 grams of protein, 80 grams of fat, and 240 grams of carbohydrates.
