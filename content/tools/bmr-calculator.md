## What is Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)?

The basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents the minimal amount of energy necessary to support essential bodily functions such as respiration, digestion, and circulation, all involuntary processes.

## Can I Calculate my Basal Metabolic Rate?

Yes. You can use a BMR (Basal Metabolic Rate) calculator. This tool estimates the amount of energy your body burns at rest, which means the minimum amount of energy your body needs to maintain essential life-sustaining functions such as breathing, circulation, and organ function.

A BMR calculator typically uses various factors such as age, gender, height, weight, and activity level to estimate the BMR. Once you have calculated your BMR, you can use it to determine the [number of calories](/tools/calorie-calculator) you should consume daily to maintain your current weight or to achieve your weight loss or weight gain goals.

BMR calculators are commonly used by nutritionists, fitness enthusiasts, and healthcare professionals to help individuals determine their daily caloric needs and to develop personalized diet and exercise plans.

## How to calculate my BMR

There are different methods to measure your BMR, including:

1. [Resting metabolic rate (RMR)](/tools/metabolic-rate-calculator) measurement involves breathing into a mask that measures the amount of oxygen your body uses and the amount of carbon dioxide you exhale. This is usually done in a lab or clinic.
2. Prediction equations: BMR can also be estimated using prediction equations that consider your age, gender, height, and weight. The most common prediction equation used is the Harris-Benedict equation.
3. Online BMR calculators: You can use online BMR calculators that estimate your BMR based on the same factors as the prediction equations.

Remember that these methods estimate your BMR and may not be 100% accurate. The most precise way to determine your BMR is through RMR measurement in a lab or clinic.

## How BMR is measured

We will use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, another commonly used formula to estimate BMR, considered more accurate than the Harris-Benedict equation. Here's the formula:

**For men:**

BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) + 5

**For women:** 

BMR = (10 x weight in kg) + (6.25 x height in cm) - (5 x age in years) - 161

## Over to you 

To measure your BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, follow these steps:

1. Weigh yourself in kilograms and measure your height in centimetres.
2. Determine your age in years.
3. Plug your weight, height, and age into the appropriate equation above.

For example, let's say you are a 40-year-old woman who weighs 70 kilograms and is 165 centimetres tall. 

To estimate your BMR using the Mifflin-St Jeor equation, you would use the following formula:

BMR = (10 x 70) + (6.25 x 165) - (5 x 40) - 161
BMR = 1,344 calories per day

This means that your body requires approximately 1,344 calories daily to sustain essential life-sustaining functions, assuming you are at rest and not engaging in physical activity.
