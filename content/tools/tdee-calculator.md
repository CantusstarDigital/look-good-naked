## How Many Calories Should I Eat Per Day?

The calculation used in the TDEE calculator is based on the Mifflin-St Jeor equation for estimating Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and then multiplying it by an activity factor to determine the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE). Here's the breakdown of the calculations:

1. BMR calculation using Mifflin-St Jeor equation:
- For males: BMR = (10 * weightInKg) + (6.25 * heightInCm) - (5 * age) + 5
- For females: BMR = (10 * weightInKg) + (6.25 * heightInCm) - (5 * age) - 161
2. TDEE calculation by multiplying BMR with the activity level:
- TDEE = BMR * activityLevel

The Mifflin-St Jeor equation is a widely used and well-accepted method for estimating BMR. It takes into account the individual's weight, height, age, and sex. After calculating the BMR, the TDEE is determined by multiplying the BMR with an activity factor, which represents the individual's activity level. This activity factor is an estimate of how many calories a person burns daily based on their physical activities.

Consider adjusting your daily calorie intake by increments of 500 calories. To lose or gain 1lb/0.5kg per week, subtract or add 500 calories from your daily TDEE, respectively, which equates to a 3500 calorie difference per week, distributed evenly over seven days. If your goal is to lose or gain 2lb/1kg per week, you would need to make adjustments of 1000 calories in either direction.
