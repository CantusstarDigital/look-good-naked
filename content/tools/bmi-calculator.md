## What is a BMI Calculator?
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that determines a person's BMI by considering their weight and height.

BMI is a widely used metric for assessing an individual's body weight to height. It can provide a general understanding of whether a person is underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese.

## How BMI is measured

Calculating your BMI with your height and weight can help you understand how your body fat affects your health. Discuss your BMI and other health measurements with your healthcare provider to identify ways to reduce disease risk and improve overall wellness.

### Metric
- **Formula:** weight (kg) / [height (m)]<sup>2</sup>
- **Example:** weight = 68 kg, height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
- **BMI calculation:** 68 / (1.65)<sup>2</sup> = 24.98

### Imperial
- **Formula:** weight (lb) / [height (in)]<sup>2</sup> x 703
- **Example:** weight = 150 lbs, height = 5’5” (65")
- **BMI calculation:** [150 / (65)2] x 703 = 24.96

## BMI Ranges
A BMI calculator typically asks for a person's weight and height and then calculates the BMI value based on these inputs. The resulting BMI value is then placed within specific categories defined by the World Health Organization (WHO):

| Weight Category   | BMI Measurement |
| ------ | --- |
| Underweight | < 18.5 |
| Normal weight | 18.5 - 24.9 |
| Overweight | 25 - 29.9 |
| Obesity class I (Moderate) | 30 - 34.9 |
| Obesity class II (Severe) | 35 - 39.9 |
| Obesity class III (Very severe or morbidly) | > 40 |

## High BMI

High BMI is associated with an increased risk of various health problems, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, certain cancers, and musculoskeletal disorders. It is essential to maintain a healthy BMI to lower the risk of developing these health issues.

## Low BMI

A very low BMI can also pose health risks, such as malnutrition, anaemia, weakened immune system, osteoporosis, and an increased risk of falls and fractures. These risks can be especially concerning for older adults and those with eating disorders. Maintaining a healthy weight in a safe and sustainable way is essential to avoid these health risks.

## Special Note

While BMI is a commonly used measure of health, it has limitations. It may not accurately reflect body fat distribution or differentiate between fat and muscle mass, leading to inaccurate results for athletes and elderly individuals. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional and consider other factors for a more comprehensive health assessment.
