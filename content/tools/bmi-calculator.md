## What is a BMI Calculator?
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that determines a person's BMI by considering their weight and height.

BMI is a widely used metric for assessing an individual's body weight to height. It can provide a general understanding of whether a person is underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese.

## BMI Ranges
A BMI calculator typically asks for a person's weight and height and then calculates the BMI value based on these inputs. The resulting BMI value is then placed within specific categories defined by the World Health Organization (WHO):

Underweight:	BMI below 18.5
Normal weight	BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight	BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity class I (Moderate)	BMI between 30 and 34.9
Obesity class II (Severe)	BMI between 35 and 39.9
Obesity class III (Very severe or morbidly)	BMI over 40

## Special Note

It's important to note that BMI is just one measure of a person's health and has limitations. For instance, it does not differentiate between fat and muscle mass, so athletes and bodybuilders may have a high BMI even though they are not overweight or obese.

Similarly, older individuals or those with low muscle mass may have a lower BMI despite having excess body fat. It's always best to consider other factors and consult a healthcare professional for a more comprehensive health assessment.
