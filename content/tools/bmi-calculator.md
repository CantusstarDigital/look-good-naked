## What is a BMI Calculator?
A BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator is a tool that determines a person's BMI by considering their weight and height.

BMI is a widely used metric for assessing an individual's body weight to height. It can provide a general understanding of whether a person is underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese.

## BMI Ranges
A BMI calculator typically asks for a person's weight and height and then calculates the BMI value based on these inputs. The resulting BMI value is then placed within specific categories defined by the World Health Organization (WHO):

| Category   | BMI |
| ------ | --- |
| Underweight | < 18.5 |
| Normal weight | 18.5 - 24.9 |
| Overweight | 25 - 29.9 |
| Obesity class I (Moderate) | 30 - 34.9 |
| Obesity class II (Severe) | 35 - 39.9 |
| Obesity class III (Very severe or morbidly) | > 40 |

## Special Note

It's important to note that BMI is just one measure of a person's health and has limitations. For instance, it does not differentiate fat and muscle mass, so athletes and bodybuilders may have a high BMI even though they are not overweight or obese.

Similarly, older individuals or those with low muscle mass may have a lower BMI despite having excess body fat. It's always best to consider other factors and consult a healthcare professional for a more comprehensive health assessment.
