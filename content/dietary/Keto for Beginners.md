## Intro to Keto 

Embarking on a ketogenic (keto) diet can be a life-changing decision, but it can also be intimidating for beginners. This ultimate guide will walk you through the essential steps to starting and succeeding on a keto diet, covering the basics, meal planning, and valuable tips to make your keto journey as smooth as possible.

## Understanding the Keto Diet

The keto diet is a low-carbohydrate, high-fat, and moderate-protein eating plan to put your body into a metabolic state called ketosis. In ketosis, your body becomes more efficient at burning fat for energy and producing ketones in the liver, which can supply power to the brain. The primary benefits of the keto diet include weight loss, improved mental clarity, and increased energy levels.<sup>(1)(2)</sup>

## Setting Your Keto Diet Goals

Before starting the keto diet, it's essential to establish your health and wellness goals. Whether aiming for weight loss, improved mental focus, or enhanced athletic performance, having clear goals will help you stay motivated and track your progress <sup>(3)</sup>.

## Calculating Your Macros

You must consume the right macronutrient balance to achieve and maintain ketosis. A typical keto diet consists of the following:
- 70-80% of daily calories from fats
- 20-25% of proteins
- 5-10% from carbohydrates <sup>(4)</sup>

Use a keto macro calculator to determine your daily calorie and macronutrient needs based on age, gender, weight, height, and activity level <sup>(5)</sup>.

## Planning Keto-Friendly Meals

Meal planning is crucial for keto diet success. Focus on incorporating whole, nutrient-dense foods such as healthy fats (avocado, nuts, seeds, and olive oil), proteins (meat, fish, poultry, and eggs), and low-carb vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, and zucchini). Keep processed foods, sugar, and high-carb options to a minimum <sup>(6)</sup>.

## Managing Keto Flu Symptoms

During the initial phase of the keto diet, some people experience flu-like symptoms, commonly referred to as the "keto flu." These symptoms are usually temporary, including fatigue, dizziness, headaches, and irritability. Stay hydrated, replenish electrolytes, get adequate rest, and gradually decrease your carbohydrate intake to minimise these symptoms <sup>(7)</sup>.

## Tracking Your Progress

Monitor your progress by measuring your ketone levels using ketone strips, breath analysers, or blood ketone meters. Regularly track your body measurements and weight, and take progress photos to stay motivated and ensure you're moving toward your goals <sup>(8)</sup>.

## Staying Committed and Adapting

Consistency is vital in the keto diet. Remain committed to your goals and be prepared to make adjustments as needed. If you hit a plateau or encounter challenges, consider recalculating your macros, evaluating your food choices, or consulting a nutrition professional <sup>(9)</sup>.

## Starting and succeeding

Starting and succeeding on a keto diet requires a solid understanding of the basics, goal setting, meal planning, and commitment. Embrace the process and enjoy the transformative benefits of the ketogenic diet. Following this ultimate guide will enable you to embark on your keto journey and achieve your health and wellness goals.
