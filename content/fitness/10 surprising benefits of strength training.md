Want muscles? Do strength training. We all know this little tidbit. But did you know that bigger guns are not where it stops? While weight training is often associated with muscle gains and sculpting, this powerful fitness component offers a wealth of lesser-known benefits beyond the gym. 

In this enlightening journey, you'll uncover how a simple dumbbell helps you achieve your desired physique AND enhances various aspects of your life, from cognitive function to sleep quality. So, let's dive into this fascinating realm and discover how strength training can transform your approach to fitness, ultimately leading to a healthier, more balanced lifestyle.

## 1. Improved Cognitive Function ##

Strength training plays a significant role in enhancing cognitive performance and maintaining mental sharpness as we age. Research has shown that individuals who incorporate strength training into their fitness routines experience better cognitive performance, including enhanced memory, problem-solving skills, and mental flexibility. By engaging in regular resistance exercises, you stimulate neural pathways responsible for attention, memory, and executive functioning <sup>(1)</sup>.

> Strength training improves the performance of the mental processes of perception, learning, memory, understanding, awareness, reasoning, judgment, intuition, and language.

Moreover, strength training has been associated with a reduced risk of cognitive decline and dementia in older adults. The increase in blood flow to the brain during exercise promotes the growth of new neurons and helps maintain existing neural connections. This process, known as neurogenesis, is vital for preserving cognitive function and delaying the onset of age-related cognitive decline. As a result, incorporating strength training into your fitness regimen benefits your physical well-being and supports long-term brain health and mental acuity.

## 2. Increased Bone Density ##

Regular resistance training enhances bone density and promotes overall bone health. By subjecting your bones to mechanical stress through weight-bearing exercises, you stimulate the process of bone remodelling, which involves the resorption of old bone tissue and the formation of new bone. This increase in bone density helps to combat the natural decline in bone mass that occurs as we age, ultimately reducing the risk of osteoporosis and fractures later in life <sup>(2)</sup>.

Increased bone density is better because it strengthens your skeletal system, reducing the risk of fractures and osteoporosis as you age.

## 3. Enhanced Metabolism ##

Strength training helps build muscle, which in turn increases your metabolism. In simple terms, having more muscle allows your body to burn more calories, even when just sitting or resting (or hitting the Xbox hard). This is because muscle tissue is more metabolically active than fat tissue, requiring more energy to maintain. All this to say, incorporating strength training into your fitness routine, you can boost your metabolism and improve your overall body composition.

Enhanced metabolism is better for you because it allows your body to burn more calories efficiently, helping you maintain a healthy weight and improve overall body composition.

## 4. Better Insulin Sensitivity ##

Strength training can help improve your body's response to insulin, a hormone responsible for regulating blood sugar levels. In other words, it makes your body more efficient at using insulin to process sugar from food. Picking up a barbell and throwing it around as if you were Arnold himself can drastically improve your insulin sensitivity. This is particularly beneficial for people with or at risk for diabetes, as better insulin sensitivity can help manage and prevent the condition <sup>(3)</sup>. 

Better insulin sensitivity is good for you because it helps your body regulate blood sugar levels more effectively, reducing the risk of developing diabetes and promoting overall metabolic health.

## 5. Improved Balance and Stability ##

If you are accident prone, like me, losing balance from getting up because your mind is 12 multiverses away thinking about who knows what, well, some gym time can help. When you engage in strength training, you're sculpting your physique and improving your balance, coordination, and overall stability. As your muscles become stronger, they provide better support and control over your body's movements, ultimately reducing the likelihood of falls and injuries. This is especially beneficial in everyday activities and as you age, helping you maintain your independence and enjoy a higher quality of life.

## 6. Better Posture ##

We spend hours in front of our computers daily, hunched over the keyboard as we work, play, or send rockets to the moon. This seemingly "harmless" habit can lead to poor posture, contributing to discomfort, pain, and even long-term health issues.

By incorporating strength training into your routine, you can develop strong muscles in your back and core, which are essential for maintaining proper posture. With a well-conditioned and balanced muscular system, you'll be better equipped to correct any slouching or misalignment caused by sitting for extended periods. Not only does improved posture help alleviate discomfort and strain on your spine, but it enhances your overall appearance, making you look taller, more confident, and poised.

So, the next time you find yourself sinking into that familiar slouch on your favourite overpriced desk chair, remember the power of strength training to transform your posture and help you feel more comfortable and confident.

## 7. Increased Flexibility and Mobility ##

Yoga and Pilates are often hailed as the go-to workouts for flexibility and mobility, but strength training holds a joker card up its sleeve that you might not expect.

Contrary to popular belief, strength training can significantly improve flexibility and mobility when performed correctly and combined with stretching exercises. By incorporating a well-rounded strength training routine that targets various muscle groups, you build muscle and enhance your muscles' range of motion. This improved range of motion increases flexibility, allowing you to move more freely and efficiently in your daily activities.

Moreover, strength training can help you maintain and improve joint mobility, essential for preventing stiffness and reducing the risk of injury. As you work on building muscle, you're also supporting the health of your joints and promoting a balanced, flexible, and mobile body. 

So, pay attention to the power of strength training in boosting your flexibility and mobility - it might just be the secret weapon you need to reach your fitness goals.

## 8. Enhanced Mental Health ##

Mental health is a biggie, and while actual therapy (which I strongly endorse) plays a crucial role in addressing mental health issues, weight training can also positively impact.

Regular strength training can help alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress by releasing feel-good hormones called endorphins. These natural chemicals produced by your body can boost your mood and help you feel more relaxed and positive.

In addition to the endorphin release, strength training promotes a sense of accomplishment as you witness your progress and achieve personal milestones in your fitness journey. Setting and reaching goals, lifting weights, or completing more repetitions can instil pride and self-confidence. This improved self-esteem can improve mental health, helping you combat negative emotions and feel more in control of your life.

Strength training offers a holistic approach to wellness, benefiting your body and mind and serving as a valuable addition to your mental health care routine.

## 9. Better Sleep Quality ##

When asked about Arnold Schwarzenegger's sleep patterns and getting only 4-6 hours, he famously answered, "just sleep faster." Whether or not its true, it just highlights the importance of quality when it comes to sleep.

Regular exercise helps regulate your body's natural sleep-wake cycle, making falling and staying asleep throughout the night easier. Physical activity, including strength training, has been shown to positively impact sleep quality and help combat insomnia. Moreover, strength training can help alleviate stress and anxiety, which are common factors contributing to sleep disturbances.

A good night's sleep is crucial for optimal physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Strength training can be valuable in ensuring you get the restorative rest you need. By incorporating strength training into your fitness routine, you build muscle, improve your overall health, and promote better sleep quality.

While you may not be able to "sleep faster" like Arnold, you can certainly strive for better sleep quality by including strength training in your regular exercise regimen.

## 10. Reduced Risk of Chronic Conditions ##

Strength training is beneficial for building muscle and improving overall fitness but has also been linked to a reduced risk of developing chronic conditions such as heart disease, obesity, and certain types of cancer. Maintaining a consistent strength training routine can promote better overall health and decrease the likelihood of encountering these severe health issues.

In a 2019 study, Liu and colleagues investigated the associations between resistance exercise (strength training) and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. The researchers found that regular strength training was associated with a significantly lower risk of developing heart disease and other cardiovascular issues. This study demonstrates the importance of incorporating strength training into a well-rounded fitness routine for its immediate benefits and long-term impact on chronic disease prevention<sup>(4)</sup>.

## Over to you

Strength training has a treasure trove of great goodies in its bag to combat the little devils of age and promote overall well-being. We can list all the different muscle groups and how they get bigger and stronger through strength training, but the benefits of this type of exercise extend far beyond mere aesthetics. 

Strength training offers a holistic approach to health that should not be overlooked, from improved cognitive function and bone density to better sleep quality and reduced risk of chronic conditions. So, embrace the power of strength training in your fitness journey and unlock its numerous surprising benefits for a healthier, happier life.
