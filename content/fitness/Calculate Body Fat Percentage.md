Body fat percentage is the proportion of your total body weight that is composed of fat. It is a more accurate indicator of your health than body weight or body mass index (BMI) alone, as it takes into account the distribution of fat and muscle in your body. A healthy body fat percentage varies based on factors such as age, sex, and activity level, but generally falls within a specific range for optimal health.

Calculating your body fat percentage is important for several reasons:

1. **Health assessment:** A high body fat percentage increases the risk of various health issues, such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. By knowing your body fat percentage, you can take preventive measures to lower your risk.

2. **Fitness goals:** Measuring your body fat percentage can help you set realistic fitness goals, whether you're looking to lose fat, gain muscle, or maintain your current physique.

3. **Tracking progress:** Regularly monitoring your body fat percentage allows you to assess the effectiveness of your diet and exercise routine and make necessary adjustments to stay on track.

4. **Motivation:** Seeing improvements in your body fat percentage can serve as a powerful motivator to continue pursuing a healthier lifestyle.
